This is a mini-side project in ReactJS based on Colt Steele's exercise from his React course on Udemy.com.

By no way is this an intent to steal the work he did. I simply made his dad jokes exercise and added a few features to it to make it my 'own'. 90 % is following the course. I added a delete button with style. Changed up a few pieces in the code and applied flip-move animation to the list.

Credit goes out to Colt Steele's 100 %
